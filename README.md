# Carriculum Vitae
# Article before developing the webpage (Phase 1)
- Developing my Curriculum Vitae as a website using HTML and CSS. After developing the website the plan is to host it on the Internet. 

# Article after the completion of the task
The final masterpiece of the webpage is done using HTML and CSS. It took a bunch of HTML and CSS lines of code to complete the project (since they are constantly evolving, I can't state how many lines 游때). I have tried to make the website responsive for different viewports. It is a simple and basic carriculum vitae with no additional linked pages apart from the homepage. Give it a look!
As promised before completing the task, I have hosted the webpage. Didn't know hosting was very easy on GitHub (before trying it out, of course). 游때游때游때
